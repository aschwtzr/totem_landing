We are five strangers who bonded over a common love for subculture and the physical spaces they represent. We have seen the venues we love disappear over time due economic pressure, often the victims of their own success. We believe in two key principles that make this possible:

1. Acknowledging the presence of a stranger is at once one of the most powerful and simple things we can do.
2. The participants who benefit the most from community spaces are at the periphery rather than at the center of cultural participation.
